                            is an open club for both philosophy and non-philosophy majors which meets weekly to discuss one among a broad range of philosophical topics.
                            Recent topics have included population ethics, alterative systems of logic, and the value of a human life.
                            My primary responsibility as an officer is to present on a philosophical topic for 90 minutes, several times a semester.
                            My most recent topics have been on artificial consciousness, dharma, and the psychology of love.

                            dedicated to ending political corruption in the United States. Specifically targeted is gerrymandering and the campaigning process. 
                            The UW chapter has a special strength in that we can draw in members from across the state and country, so we have the potential to 
                            influence many voting districts rather than the one that, say, the Madison chapter can. <br>
                            I am currently in the process of building this chapter, essentially from scratch. This involves planning for future events so we can give 
                            recruits a reason to come, and recruiting so we have the power to execute on events.

                            As a scout, I had the opportunity to do many adventurous things and fostered lasting friendships. 
                            In my final three years as a scout, I Served my troop as Senior Patrol Leader. 
                            During this time it was my responsibility to plan, organize, and lead troop meetings.
                            I was also singly selected to become trained in the National Youth Leadership Training course, and was inducted into 
                            the Order of the Arrow, Scouting's honor society, where I went on to become a Brotherhood member.

                            In the fall of 2018, leading up to the elecction, I worked with two other students to promote a desperately needed funding increase to the Forest Lake School District. 
                            In collaboration with the district superintendent, we designed and executed on a number of projects: 
                            We recorded, edited and released <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiBnXWOWmrM&list=PLvKFXtI_Geg56ZYsWKzJsy5OnsavSwgPh">informational videos</a>,
                            distributed yard signs, wrote columns in the city and county papers, 
                            organized citywide demonstrations, and got <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/in-forest-lake-students-lead-the-charge-for-school-funding/89-607751760">interviewed by Kare 11</a>,

                            Our efforts, along with those of the adult teams, led to our narrow victory. 
                            That success meant an additional $44 million to the school district over the next 8 years.

                            The Student PAC was a small group of high school students with the goal of bringing representation to the student body in local politics.
                            In my time as leader, I undertook several major projects: 
                            Over several years, I worked with the Forest Lake City Council to renovate a local park with a plan I put together with an architect and former mayoral candidate, based on the interests of the students, on a budget of about $500,000.
                            I also organized and moderated a mayoral debate in the fall, and a Q&A with the new mayor in the spring, both hosted at the high school, and geared toward the goal of student political envolement.

                            In my two years of service in the NHS, I volunteered over 250 hours through various events and organizations. 
                            This primarily involved tutoring, ranging from grades 2 - 12, as well as food collections, and planning and executing fundraisers.
                            My favorite and mosr regular service was in going to my former elementary school, Scandia Elementary, and tutoring a group of kids in an after school program.
