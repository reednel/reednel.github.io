                                It's Your Move is an ambitious athletics project from the team that worked on 
                                <a target="_blank" href="http://raam.davehaase.com/">The Perfect Race</a> 
                                project for Dave Haase's 
                                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raceacrossamerica.org/">Race Across America</a> in 2019.
                                The long term goal of this ongoing endeavor is both to motivate ley folk to build and stick to fitness habits, and to satiate the 
                                desires of hardcore athletes concerned with data like glucose level, core temperature, and more. Currently, the focus is on
                                getting these core systems constructed for a diverse few high-performance athletes. 
                                This effort integrates software and hardware from athletic, medical, IoT and AI areas into a unified platform.
                                My contribution to this platfrom lies primarily in the front-end development of the web app.

                        <p>
                            A <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequence">de Bruijn Sequence</a> 
                            is a cyclic sequence of characters from an alphabet A of length k, which contains all permutations of n characters, 
                            exactly once each. Uses for such sequences range from card tricks to gene sequencing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I developed algorithms as tools for 
                            <a target="_blank" href="">Ben Cartford</a>, 
                            an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota doing research on these sequences. 
                            Most notably and most novel among these tools was an algorithm to generate every de Bruijn sequence for a given alphabet and window. 
                            This process involves generating a graph corresponding the given alphabet and window ('n' value), traversing the graph's
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path">eulerian paths</a>, and parsing out the unique ones. 
                            Space and time efficiency are imperative here, as there are 2<sup>120</sup>, or about 1.3E<sup>36</sup> unique sequences 
                            for merely the k = 2 and n = 8, for example.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To design optimal algorithms, my work on this project involved building an intimate understanding of de Bruijn sequences, 
                            and getting comfortable with the associated graph theory and combinatorics. In addition to answering questions, 
                            calculations made through this endeavor led to discoery of patterns unseen by us, and more points of interests for the research.

                            a cellular automaton designed by the recently passed 
                            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Conway#">John Conway</a>,
                            is a 'game' played out on a discretely mutating 2D grid of square, binary cells. 
                            The state of the each cell in the grid from one 'generation' (grid state) to the next is determined by the states of its 'neighbors' (immediately adjacent cells). 
                            For example, if a cell is 'alive' in the curent generation, and has more than 3 living neighbors, it will be dead in the next generation as if by overpopulation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My rendition of this classic game is highly interactive. The board can be popuated randomly, manually by individual toggle or by click and drag, or with a preset imported from a file.
                            The board can also be cleared, as well as re-populated at any time, as well as mutated live, and paused. 
                            The rate of state change and the grid size are adjustable, and a record of the game's states can be saved to a chosen file location. 
                            Using the extensive implementation of the JavaFX library, the program features a friendly and pretty user interface.
